# Work_with_HIBERNATE

1. Create a Cart model with the fields: {id, total, name, Set <Item>} and an Item model with the fields: {id, total, Set <Cart>}. Classes correspond to the Many-to-Many bundle

2. Using Hibernate with XML settings, map this model to a table in the database.

3. Create an Application class and write code to populate Card class objects with a list of 4 Item objects in the database.
